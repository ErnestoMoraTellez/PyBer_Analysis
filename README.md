# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of PyBer Analysis

We are working for PyBer. As first job we need to do an exploratory analysis for some date about transportation. We hace some city and drivers information. We have to create some visual graph using pandas and matplotlib librery. 

## Purpose

We need to create a summary of the ride-sharing data by city type, and show a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type. We want to help Pyber to determine affordability for the regions.

## Pyber analysis results

For Pyber analysis, we have several data from diferent cities, drivers, rides, and fares. The next graph shows a summary about the information. We can see that is group by the tipe of cities [Rural,Suburban,Urban]. Aslo we can see the total number ob riders, drivers and fares with the average fare per ride and driver.

We can notice that the urban cities has the bigger number of riders and drivers. That's why there is also the higher amount of fares. But this also made the average fare per ride and  driver the cheaper.

The graph above shows the total fares by city type per week. From January 2019 until the end of April. We can see the different tendencies by the time.

## Summary

-From the results we can recommend to control the number of riders in urban cities. They have the higher fares, but there is the double number of drivers than riders.

-Promote the app in rural cities to increase the number of rides.

-The fares in suburban cities seems to increase, so probably they need more drivers to cover the demand.
